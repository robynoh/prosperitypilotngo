                                <p>Every once in the life of a people, the heavens kiss the earth and there occurs an event that permanently alters the destinies of nations. The 13th day of February, 2020, was one of such days and will Forever
remain indelible in the thoughts and memories of Bayelsans. On that epochal day, the entire country was left stunned by the miraculous and sudden turnaround in the governorship Fortunes ofrhe two leading political parties in Bayelsa State. The Supreme Court aborted what would have amounted to one of the most egregious electoral heists in the annals of the democratic experience of Nigeria.
</p>

                                <p>All of us recall that after the governorship elections in November, in contraindication to the votes and wishes of Bayelsans, another candidate was declared winner. Yet against all expectations and hope, God intervened. This extraordinary reversal produced the "Miracle Governor" and has set Bayelsa State on the course of irreversible growth and progress.</p>
                           

<P>Curiously, in spite of the Fact that the government of H.E Sen. Douye Diri, notwithstanding a lean purse, has been adjudged by the preponderance of honest independent observers to have scaled all development indices in the less than two years in office, a small but vociferous clan of naysayers are determined to distract, detract and thwart the work that is being done. It is not surprising, thus that, the bible declares in 1 Corinthians 16:9 (Amplified), "a wide door For effective service has opened to me [a very promising opportunity], and there are many adversaries.".</P>
						  
<P>It is in response to such Fringe but strong-minded set of professional rabblerousers, that "Prosperity Pilot Initiative" (PPI) was birthed. PPI is a consortium of intellectuals, politicians, technocrats and Bayelsans From all walks of life. The one thing that aggregates/amalgamates our variegated interests and unites our purpose is our love For Bayelsa State and belief in the Prosperity Agenda of Governor Douye Diri. That basically instructs the philosophy behind the name "Prosperity Pilot Initiative." We share a conviction that the Governor's mandate of prosperity has been activated in Bayelsa State to impact the citizenry and that it has been the driving Force behind the projects, policies and programmes, the Government of Senator Douye Diri is embarking on.</P>
						  
						  <P>The PPI is intended and organized to help steer information regarding the ship of prosperity to reach out to all nooks and crannies From the unit, ward,Local Government Area, National Assembly consmuencies, through to the entire voting structure of the state</P>
						  <P>The association was Formed as an outcome of many social interactions and cross ventilating of ideas, and arriving at a consensus that people need to support and promote and propagate the Prosperity Agenda of the Governor. And so, the Pilot is a vehicle that is created, call it a Special Purpose Vehicle, to drive the policy thrust of
the divinely installed government and the Prosperity Agenda to the outermost regions of the state.
</P>

<P>Our conviction and support For the agenda of the government of His Excellency is solidly Founded on empirical and verifiable track record of unexampled achievements. Whereas a few persons will otherwise agree, they are in a clear minority, probably driven by sentiments of malice  and  envy;  this  has  a biblical parallel in Genesis 26.12 - 14 "Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. And
the man waxed great, and went Forward, and grew until he became very great: For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him."
</P>
<P>Fortunately, in 2 Kings 6:16, we are remined that, "They that are with us, are greater than they that are with them." Beyond polemics, Senator Douye Diri is enjoying some of the best support you can ever desire For any politician at all level, growing in popularity and building not only very strong physical, but political bridges across the state. So, whereas,  remarkably not everyone seems to love such progress,  we are merely disappointed but not surprised.</P>
						  
						 
<P>The Prosperity Pilot Initiative is primed to open a new vista of interface with the Bayelsa public to counter the propaganda of the opposition and disabuse their negative  rhetoric,  because  people look at the policies and programs of government  From  their individual or group perspectives. When they go low, we go high. It is only a Fool who argues with infallible proofs.</P>						
<P>The remarkable leadership qualities displayed by His Excellency, has not left those who know his pedigree astonished. He is not an accidental leader, but a man groomed and ready For his assignment. It is interesting to take cognizance ofrhe Fact that as a young man, H.E, Sen. Douye Diri was part of a select group of patriots who agitated and Fought For the birth of a homogeneous ljaw state, expressed today as Bayelsa State. The vision of our founding fathers was to engender a polity that was careful to provide a platform For inclusive prosperity For all citizens of the enclave. 25 years down the line, by divine providence he has the mantle of leading this state. The Prosperity Agenda is thus providential and divine.</P>
<P>Yet like we have earlier said, our confidence in the Vision is not predicated on religious zealotry or blind loyalty, but on empirical and irrefutable evidence of outstanding performance.   </P>
 
 <P>He came into office with a solid track record  of  unblemished  experience. It is rare to Find a man with such a tall resume of experience  and  quality  For  the  position  of  governor.  He  has distinguished himself in every assignment thathas been entrusted to him. He was elected the First National Organizing Secretary of the Foremost pan- ljaw organization, the ljaw National Congress (INC) in 1 9 9    2, a clear testament to his passionate love For his
people and desire to fight For the unfreedom. He was also appointed Executive Secretary, Centre For Youth Development in Bayelsa State between 2000 and 2002 during the tenure of the First Executive Governor of Bay e Is a state, ChieF D .S. P Alamieyeseigha. He served the state as Commissioner ForYouth and Sports during Dr. Goodluck Jonathan's administration as
Governor between 2006 and 2007 and was key to the state clinching the male and Female Nigerian premier league titles, a Feat both remarkable and unprecedented. He became governing Council Board member  University  of Maiduguri From 2008-
2012. In his service to the party, the Senator w a s a p p o i n t e d Chairman of the 
P e o p l e ' s Democratic      Party (PDP) Disciplinary Council, BayelsaState in 2012.

</P>

<P> 

Senator Diri was in August 2012, appointed Deputy Chief of Staff, Government House and a year later was appointed Principal Executive Secretary to the Governor, a position he held until 2014 when he contested and won election into the Federal House of Representatives to representYenagoa/Kolokuma/ Opokuma Federal Constituency. As the saying goes "one good term, deserves another" and he was in fact elevated and elected as the Senator representing Bayelsa Central SenatoriaI District in the NationaIAssembly.
</P>
 
 <P>Douye Diri is anindependent-minded leader with a calm temperament,
charismatic speaking skills and a flair For consensus-building. He also possesses a deeply dynamic and introspective mind, capable of seeing all sides of an issue, without compromising the Fundamentals. </P>
 
 <P>His values are strongly shaped by his years of teaching and mentoring of the underdog in rural communities, love of sports and by his Christian Faith.</P>
 
 <P>Whether addressing large crowds or speaking to individuals,  he relates easily with others and ensures that everyone Feels a part of the family. He is thus, both respected and admired For being courageous to speak and hear hard truths when necessary.</P>
 
 <P>We are particularly keen to describe His Excellency in his own words, ""There is a tide in the affairs of man..:'This is a metaphor which means literally that there is an occasion in each man's life when he must commit himself to a course of action. From humble beginnings, I have come a long way by God's grace, unstinting industry and commitment to every course I have ever embarked on:"'</P>
 <P>So our core objective is to propagate and promote the concept of the ProsperityAgenda that the government has come up with and we have an intention to consciously and deliberately publicize and announce all the activities of government to the Bayelsa people irrespective of political divide. Our aim is to consciously push out all policies and programs of government that is geared towards delivering on the Prosperity Mandate.That is our core objective, that is our vision, to take the Prosperity message as proclaimed by the Governor and spread it so the citizenry will believe and support the Governor.</P>
 <P>We are confident as the state memory verse says Isaiah 14:21, "For the LORD of hosts has purposed, And who will annul it? His hand is stretched out,And who will turn it back?"</P>
